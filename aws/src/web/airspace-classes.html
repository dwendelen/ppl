<h1>Separation and services provided</h1>
General principles
<ul>
    <li>When ATC is provided, the ATC is responsible for separation, otherwise the pilot</li>
    <li>They go from more responsibilities for the ATC to fewer</li>
    <li>ATC responsibilities are loosened on the VFR side first</li>
    <li>In controlled airspace, you get ATC or traffic information</li>
    <li>In uncontrolled airspace, you get FIS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Class A</h2>
<p>Only IFR is allowed</p>
<canvas id="class-a" height="50"></canvas>

<h2>Class B</h2>
<p>VFR is also allowed</p>
<canvas id="class-b" height="50"></canvas>
<h2>Class C</h2>

<p>Loosen VFR/VFR</p>
<canvas id="class-c" height="50"></canvas>
<p>Instead of ATC, VFR will get traffic information and, if requested, traffic avoidance advice</p>

<h2>Class D</h2>
<p>Loosen VFR/IFR</p>
<canvas id="class-d" height="50"></canvas>

<h2>Class E</h2>
<p>Communication is no longer required for VFR</p>
<canvas id="class-e" height="50"></canvas>
<p>ATC can no longer guarantee anything in regard to VFR, so the traffic information is only &quot;as far as practical&quot;. ATC will also stop giving traffic avoidance advice.</p>

<h2>Class F</h2>
<p>Uncontrolled airspace</p>
<canvas id="class-f" height="50"></canvas>
<p>This is uncontrolled airspace, so traffic information becomes FIS.</p>
<p>This is uncontrolled airspace, so ATC has no authority. They can only separate IFR from IFR by providing air traffic advisory service. Therefor, the separation is only &quot;as far as practical&quot;.</p>

<h2>Class G</h2>
<p>Free-for-all</p>

<h1>Speed limitation</h1>
<p>When the pilot has some responsibility for separation, then a speed limit of 250 KIAS is in place under FL100.</p>
<p>One way to think of it, is like this. The speed limit is there for the general aviation, and they typically do not fly above FL100. We also need enough time to react when we see another plane, this becomes difficult when they fly very fast.</p>

<h1>Radio communication</h1>
<p>It's always required for IFR, but for VFR, it's only required for classes B, C and D.</p>
<p>Remember, the big feature about class E is that radio communication is no longer required for VFR.</p>

<h1>Clearance</h1>
<p>You always need clearance in controlled airspace, except for VFR in class E.</p>
<p>VFR can't ask for clearance because they don't always have a radio</p>
